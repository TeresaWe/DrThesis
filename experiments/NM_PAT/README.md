# Non-musicians Pitch Adjustment Test

The test is identical to the PAT for musicians, but contains a learning task at the beginning (presenting the 12 tones on two blocks of 6 with repetitions).
Within the learning phase active naming and adjustment tests included. After the learning phase a recognition test of all 12 tones (naming) and the PAT for musicians are conducted.
Within a break before the PAT an EEG system can be installed on the participants head. The PAT can then be started by a pres of <space> by the experimentator.


Many thanks to Hannes Schmidt & Arthur Ehle for their help and contribution in programming the experiment.
