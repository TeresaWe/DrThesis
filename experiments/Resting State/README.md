# REsting State EEG

Start of the experiment is possible by a shell-skript. The two restin state conditions (first EO, then EC) have to be started by with a button press. 
10 seconds after the button press the Resting state condition starts and a tigger is send to the EEG system. 
5 miutes later a trigger indicates the end of the condition. Afterwards, eyes-closed instruction is given and the measurements start again with a button press.

Many thanks to Hannes Schmidt his help and contribution in programming the experiment.
