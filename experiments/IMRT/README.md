# Interleaved melody recognition test (IMRT)

The experiment consists of two conditions (A, B) with containing either the first half or the second half of the melodies from Bey & McAdams, 2002,2003. 
Start of the experiment os possible by a shell-skript, which opens a GUI to select the condition and type in the participant#s code. 

While in the initial version of our experiment there was a bug with respect to the selection of trials leading to unequal distributions of trials, the current version is the final and the correct one. 

Many thanks to Hannes Schmidt & Arthur Ehle for their help and contribution in programming the experiment.
