# Experiments

The experiments of the thesis were conducted using the Python toolbox PsychoPy and additional toolboxes. 

## Content of experiments

1. AGLT= auditory global to local test (after Bouvet et al., 2011, 2014): Ascending and Descending 9-tone melodies with containing three also either ascending or descending tone triplets. Button presses (Desicion: Ascending vs. Descending) and reaction time are saved for each condition: focus on triplets and focus on whole melody

2. HL = Hierarchical letters (according to Naovn, 1977): Hierarchically letters containing 'H' or 'S' on global and/or local level and same task as in AGLT (see above). Button presses (Desicion: H vs. S) and reaction times saved.

3. IMRT = Interleaved melody recognition test (after Bey & McAdams, 2002,2003): Target melodies are followed by an interleaved sequence with a distractor melody and the task is to recognize whether the target melody is present or not. In the interleaved sequence target and distractor melodies are separated by 0,6,12 or 24 semitones to create 4 different conditions (auditory streaming experiment). Button presses (Desicion: present vs. not present) and reaction times are saved.

4. PAT and NM_PAT = Pitch adjustment test (NM= non-musicians): Active Absolute pitch test created after Dohn et al., 2014. A target musical tone label is presented on a PC screen and a random sine waves is played audially. The task is to adjust the sine wave with a USB-Controller to the correct frequency of the target musical note within 15 seconds. Button presses and time needed as well as sound files are saved for each trail and subject.

5. Resting state: Paradigm to measure exactely 5 minutes of eyes closed and eyes open EEG resting state by sending triggers to the EEG system.
