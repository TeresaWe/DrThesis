# Statistical analysis and preprocessing

To process the analysis of single experiments or measurements have a look into the respective folders. 
A general analysis taking the main skripts of all experiments to preprocess data files can be done using the script "Preprocessing.R".
This also processes the analysis of all experiments including the online survey and creates data frames for each of them. 
The file "match result tables.R" can then be used to create a joint data frame of all of them! 
Only network results have to be added manually, as this heavily depends on which of the huge amount of indicators one wishes to analyse.

The folders for AGLT, HL, IMRT and networks also contain the statistical analyses leading to three publications:
