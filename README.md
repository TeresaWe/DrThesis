# General information on use of this respository

The current repository "DrThesis" contains Matlab, Python and R scripts to programm and analyse the experiments undertaken within my (Teresa Wenhart, MSc., Bsc.) doctoral thesis at the Center for Systems Neurosciences Hannover (HGNI, University for Veterinary Medicine Hannover) and the Institute of Music Physiology and Musicians' Medicine. Subfolders contain the respective scripts for each experiment or analysis and a suited README.md to explain the steps of analysis. 
Importantly: Experiments often require condition files and visual and auditory stimuli not provided within this repository. These are available upon reasonable request by contact of: Teresa Wenhart, teresa.wenhart@hmtm-hannover.de, Eckart Altenmueller, eckart.altenmueller@hmtm-hannover.de.
